Welcome to my Python Learning Repository! 👋

In this repository, I’m sharing everything I learn while studying Python — from basic syntax to solving beginner-level problems. The goal is to track my progress and also help other beginners starting their Python journey.

📚 What You’ll Find Here
💡 Basic Concepts: Variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.

🧠 Practice Problems: Small beginner-friendly exercises with clear solutions.

🔄 Mini Projects: Simple programs like calculators, number games, or string tools.

🛠️ Hands-on Examples: Code snippets with comments to explain each step.

📁 Organized by Topics: Each folder or file focuses on one core concept.

🎯 Why I’m Doing This
I believe the best way to learn programming is by:

Practicing regularly

Solving real problems

Sharing knowledge with others

This repository not only helps me review what I've learned, but also acts as a helpful guide for new learners who want real-world examples and beginner challenges.
